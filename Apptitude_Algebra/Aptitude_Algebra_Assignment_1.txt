1.

Two quadratic equations such that the sum of roots equals twice the product of roots:
Equation 1: x^2 - (2k)x + k = 0
Equation 2: x^2 - (4k)x + 2k = 0

In both equations, k is a constant. The sum of the roots of each equation can be found using the formula:

Sum of roots = -(-2k) / 1 = 2k
Product of roots = k / 1 = k

In both equations, the sum of roots is twice the product of roots, as 2k = 2k. Hence, these quadratic equations satisfy the given condition.

To determine if the point (2,3) is a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12, we substitute x = 2 and y = 3 into the equation:
2(2) + 3(3) = 4 + 9 = 13

The equation does not hold true when we substitute the values, so (2,3) is not a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12.

3.

To find possible coordinates (x, y) such that points (1,1), (2,2), and (x, y) are collinear, we can calculate the slope between the two known points and check if it is the same as the slope between (1,1) and (x, y).
The slope between (1,1) and (2,2) is (change in y) / (change in x) = (2-1) / (2-1) = 1/1 = 1.

For the point (x, y) to be collinear with (1,1) and (2,2), the slope between (1,1) and (x, y) must also be 1. Therefore, we have:

(y - 1) / (x - 1) = 1

Simplifying the equation, we have:

y - 1 = x - 1
y = x

Hence, any coordinate (x, x) where x is a real number would make the points (1,1), (2,2), and (x, x) collinear.

The triangle formed by the lines y = x, y-axis, and y = 3 will have a base along the y-axis, with the points (0, 0) and (0, 3). The height of the triangle can be determined by finding the x-coordinate where the line y = x intersects with the line y = 3.
Setting y = 3, we have:

3 = x

So, the point of intersection is (3, 3).

The base of the triangle is the distance between (0, 0) and (0, 3), which is 3 units.

The height of the triangle is the distance between (0, 3) and (3, 3), which is 0 units.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is:

Area = (1/2) * base * height
Area = (1/2) * 3 * 0
Area = 0

Hence, the triangle formed by the lines y = x, y-axis, and y = 3 has an area of 0.
