Let's assume the capacity of the tank is T liters.
The leak in the bottom of the tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours, which means it can empty T liters of water in 6 hours. Therefore, the leak rate is T/6 liters per hour.

The inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 4 liters per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the inlet pipe fills 4 * 60 = 240 liters per hour.

When the tank is full and both the inlet pipe and the leak are open, the net rate of water being emptied from the tank is the difference between the filling rate and the leak rate. Therefore, the net rate is 240 - (T/6) liters per hour.

Given that the tank is empty in 8 hours under these conditions, we can set up the equation:

(T / (240 - (T/6))) = 8

Solving this equation will give us the capacity of the tank, T.

2.
Let's assume the total number of females in the town is F.
Given that 60% of the total population are males, the number of males in the town is (0.6 * 1000) = 600.

Given that 20% of the total population are literate, the number of literate people in the town is (0.2 * 1000) = 200.

If 25% of all inhabitants are literate, then the number of literate people in the town is (0.25 * 1000) = 250.

Since 200 out of these 250 literate people are males, the remaining 50 literate people must be females.

Therefore, the percentage of females who are literate is (50 / F) * 100.

Let's assume the total number of candidates is C.
Given that 80% of the candidates passed in English, the number of candidates who passed in English is (0.8 * C).

Given that 85% of the candidates passed in Mathematics, the number of candidates who passed in Mathematics is (0.85 * C).

Given that 73% of the candidates passed in both subjects, the number of candidates who passed in both subjects is (0.73 * C).

To find the percentage of candidates who failed in both subjects, we subtract the number of candidates who passed in both subjects from the total number of candidates:

Percentage of candidates who failed in both subjects = [(C - (0.73 * C)) / C] * 100

Let's assume the original monthly savings of the person is S.
Given that the monthly income is Rs 13,500 and the monthly expenditure is Rs 9,000, the original monthly savings can be calculated as:

S = Monthly income - Monthly expenditure
S = 13,500 - 9,000
S = 4,500

Next year, the person's income increases by 14%, so the new monthly income is:

New monthly income = 13,500 + (0.14 * 13,500)
New monthly income = 13,500 + 1,890
New monthly income = 15,390

Next year, the person's expenditure increases by 7%, so the new monthly expenditure is:

New monthly expenditure = 9,000 + (0.07 * 9,000)
New monthly expenditure = 9,000 + 630
New monthly expenditure = 9,630

The new monthly savings can be calculated as:

New monthly savings = New monthly income - New monthly expenditure
New monthly savings = 15,390 - 9,630
New monthly savings = 5,760

The percent increase in savings can be calculated as:

Percent increase in savings = [(New monthly savings - Original monthly savings) / Original monthly savings] * 100
Percent increase in savings = [(5,760 - 4,500) / 4,500] * 100
Percent increase in savings = (1,260 / 4,500) * 100
Percent increase in savings â‰ˆ 28%

Let's assume the capacity of the tank is T liters.
Given that 49 pumps can empty the tank in 10 days, working 10 hours a day, we can calculate the rate at which these pumps empty the tank:

Rate of 49 pumps = T liters / (10 days * 10 hours) = T / 100 liters per hour

If 70 pumps are used for 7 hours each day, we can calculate the rate at which these pumps empty the tank:

Rate of 70 pumps = T liters / (7 days * 7 hours) = T / 49 liters per hour

Since the rate at which the tank is emptied is directly proportional to the number of pumps, the rate of 70 pumps is (70 / 49) times the rate of 49 pumps:

Rate of 70 pumps = (70 / 49) * (T / 100) liters per hour

To find the number of days it takes to empty the tank with 70 pumps, we can set up the equation:

T liters / [(70 / 49) * (T / 100)] = Number of days

Simplifying this equation will give us the required number of days.
